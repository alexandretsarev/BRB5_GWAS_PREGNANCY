Some women experience health problems during pregnancy. These complications can involve the mother's health, the fetus's health, or both. Pregnancy complications may include pre-eclampsia, excessive toxicosis,  preterm birth, abortive outcome, and many others.  
A genome wide association study (GWAS) seeks to identify connections between genetic variants and phenotypes. Most commonly, such an analysis is aimed at identifying alleles in genes associated with various human illnesses. The results of GWAS can be used in the early diagnosis of diseases, as well as in identifying predisposition to them. In this study, we analyzed open GWAS data related to pregnancy complications from UK Biobank and GWAS Catalog resources.
